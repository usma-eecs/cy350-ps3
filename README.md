## Scenario

Your previous data analysis program has been a success, and the SPEAR team is impressed with your ability to process and analyze the rocket's telemetry data. The team has received more refined data and now you are tasked with making your program more modular and extensible by implementing classes to capture your processing logic. You have decided to write a new Python script that defines two classes: `TelemetryDataPoint` and `RocketFlight`. These classes will encapsulate the functionality needed to parse, analyze, and summarize the telemetry data.

The team also wants to understand airframe stress to ensure the rocket's structural integrity during flight. To achieve this, you need to compute vertical velocity, which is not directly provided in the telemetry logs. You will need to calculate this from the altitude and timestamp data as follows:

> velocity = (current_altitude - previous_altitude) / (current_timestamp - previous_timestamp)

If previous data point is not available, set the velocity to zero.


## Key Tasks

All of the following methods are documented in the provided starter files.

1. Define class `TelemetryDataPoint` with the following methods:
   - `__init__()`
   - `calculate_velocity()`
   - `__str__()`

2. Define class `RocketFlight` with the following methods:
   - `__init__()`
   - `load_data()`
   - `get_apogee()`
   - `get_min_voltage()`
   - `get_max_velocity()`
   - `calculate_average_velocity()`
   - `calculate_average_temperature()`
   - `calculate_average_voltage()`
   - `generate_summary_json()`

- max_altitude_km: maximum altitude in kilometers (float, rounded to 3 decimal places)
- max_altitude_timestamp: timestamp of the maximum altitude (int)
- max_velocity_m_s: maximum vertical velocity in meters per second (float, rounded to 2 decimal places)
- max_velocity_timestamp: timestamp of the maximum vertical velocity (int)
- min_voltage_v: minimum voltage (float, rounded to 2 decimal places)
- min_voltage_timestamp: timestamp of the minimum voltage (int)
